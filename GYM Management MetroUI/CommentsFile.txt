After any edit in Main Form or adding any new control rename it to name refers to its job.

Ex:
	In Main Form 
		in Settings Section
			in GYM Info tab
				the textbox which uses to config url rename it to:	txtSMSConfigURL

yes this comment file will be better.
ok i will.


	
	Edit GUI{
		Contact email & sms
		Equipments
		Settings backups
		settings ads
	}
	
	gym video -> folder
	
	in settings{
		-> View DB Manger 
		somehow we need to see db backups even internally or externally
		ex: using external small app dbViewer.exe for just view
		advanced idea: build dbs version control viewer compare current db version with old ones
		BTW "GIT" is version control system
	}
	
	db file works good with you?
	
	what is event for viewlist that controls selected item via first column checkbox in devComponents? 
	i mean i need to handle edit advertise btn to be enabled if one item selected (not multiItems || none)
	and make enabled = true for modify groupbox and path values etc..
	
	we want to finish GUI: 
	- renaming all controls that not renamed
	
	- create all confirming actions boxs but we need it to be dynamically
	ex: class confirmation path: 
		action confirmation form title, number of btns, [ex: yes no ignore],
		icon, bodyText, done actions too etc.. you got the idea ;)
