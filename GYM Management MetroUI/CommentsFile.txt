	- Add 
	{
		+ DB Folder => [Insert, Update, Result]  
	
	}

	- When You add a new class create summery for it : [ I don't know what the classes do !]
	EX:
		 /// <summary>
	  	 ///	Description Here
		 /// </summary>
		public class Class
		{ }
	-Note:
		when you write /// the summery will be created automatically!  => ok

	yes this comment file will be better.
	ok i will.

	Edit GUI{
		Contact email & sms
		Equipments
		Settings backups
		settings ads
	}: Good Work
	
	gym video -> folder
	
	in settings{
		-> View DB Manger 
		somehow we need to see db backups even internally or externally
		ex: using external small app dbViewer.exe for just view
		advanced idea: build dbs version control viewer compare current db version with old ones
		BTW "GIT" is version control system
	}
	
	db file works good with you? : Yes but needs to finish it.
	
	we want to finish GUI: 
	- renaming all controls that not renamed : Working on it.
	
	- create all confirming actions boxs but we need it to be dynamically : C# alreay provide a class which create it 'MessageBox', but i'll create a class to make it very easy. :i know but we need to build some stuff with our hands.
	ex: class confirmation path: 
		action confirmation form title, number of btns, [ex: yes no ignore],
		icon, bodyText, done actions too etc.. you got the idea ;)

	After any edit in Main Form or adding any new control rename it to name refers to its job.

	Ex:
	In Main Form 
		in Settings Section
			in GYM Info tab
				the textbox which uses to config url rename it to:	'txtSMSConfigURL'
